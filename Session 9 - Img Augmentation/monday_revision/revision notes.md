2. Vision - Muscles of Iris to modulate vision for Brain to Process
	- Other animals vision. (Different spectrums, different umvelt)
	- Evolution of vision and other senses smell & taste
	- Vision in Humans. (Mutations of 4 color)
		- Details of Vision in Humans. Rods for BnW & Cones for Colors (20:1)
		- Night Vision Hunters: More Rods
		- Rod & Cone, cells which receive light & convert to synaptic message. They are recievers of Information. Rods & Cones are receivers via Photoreceptor Proteins. (https://askabiologist.asu.edu/sites/default/files/resources/articles/seecolor/rods-cones-550.jpg)
			- 3 Types of Cones for 3 Colors, 1 type of Rod for B&W
			- Cones make 5% of photoreceptors & Rods 95%
				- Current understanding is that the 6 to 7 million cones can be divided into "red" cones (64%), "green" cones (32%), and "blue" cones (2%)
				- The rods are incredibly efficient photoreceptors. More than one thousand times as sensitive as the cones
				- Titanic Iceberg: The ship captain has red instrument lights. Since the rods do not respond to red, the captain can gain full dark-adapted vision with the rods with which to watch for icebergs and other obstacles outside. It would be undesirable to examine anything with white light even for a moment, because the attainment of optimum night-vision may take up to a half-hour. Red lights do not spoil it.
		- Human Vision
			- Spects. Correcting human vision. (hunters of past or warriors of sparta)
			- Color Blind vs Night Blindness vs 4 cone types vs Blind + extra sense
				- 6% of men have color blindness. Much less probable in women. Quarter of billion
			- Acutity of Human vision vs Eagle & Owl
			- Vision of Dogs, Cats & Humans
				- So sensitive are catsâ€™ eyes that they can detect a single photon of light in an absolutely dark environment. For reference, in a small brightly lit room, there are about one hundred billion photons at any one moment in time.
		- Dog Vision. (Motion vs Static. Distance)
		- Smartphone Camera amazing computation

LGN
- Difficulty seeing fine details: The LGN is involved in processing information about fine details in the visual image. Damage to the LGN can make it difficult to see small objects or objects that are close to each other.
- Loss of color vision: The LGN has different types of neurons that respond to different colors. Damage to the LGN can prevent these neurons from functioning properly, which can lead to loss of color vision. (color is processed at lgn. local feature, learned early and removed from the data.)
- Processing information about color, brightness, and movement: The LGN processes information about color, brightness, and movement. This information is then sent to the primary visual cortex, where it is processed further. (movement data is extracted, doesn't need understanding of the object to understand movement)
- Helping to maintain visual attention: The LGN helps to maintain visual attention. This is done by sending information about the location of objects in the visual field to the primary visual cortex. The primary visual cortex then uses this information to focus attention on specific objects. (gives information about possible attention, with local context and sends in further)
- The LGN is organized into six layers, each of which receives information from a different part of the retina. This organization allows the LGN to process information about different features of the visual image, such as color, brightness, and movement.
- The LGN has two types of neurons: magnocellular neurons and parvocellular neurons. Magnocellular neurons respond to coarse features of the visual image, such as movement and brightness. Parvocellular neurons respond to fine features of the visual image, such as color and detail.
- The LGN sends information to the primary visual cortex, where it is processed further. The primary visual cortex is responsible for processing high-level visual information, such as object recognition and motion detection.

At end of training, value in each vector is corrected "Examples / Batch_Size" times. 
Each time, its been corrected according to it's contribution in Error. 


Good exercises
1. Write your own linear layer for pytorch using pytorch
2. Write your own Conv2d layer for pytorch using pytorch. (Will allow to understand Conv2d parameters much better)
3. converting kaggle's notebook to pytorch should also be an good exercise. 
4. Write your own Linear Regression model using Pytorch from scratch & also how would you do it using numpy or jax.
5. The worst brute force way. Learning Algorithm Gradient Descent. (In one epoch, how many gradient descent & weight update operations are occuring?)
in each epoch, how many parameters are being updated. how many sequentially and how many parallely? their flops cost and their memory access cost?

# What kind of problem: Single Image = 0 to 9 Digits. (How is the problem. What does NN need to do?)
# 0 to 9 Digits MNIST. a-z English, mandrin Detector, Multiple languages, ( )
# Handwritten vs Computer Printed 0 to 9. a-z English, Multiple languages


If you were writing your own Deep Learning Library. How would you design it? It's naming and design choices. 
1. Any library made as combination of a few. There are always trade offs. Choosing required trade offs. 
2. Library + Compiler + Hardware Architecture running Flops
3. Library + Compiler + Hardware Architecture + Memory Design + Algorithms for custom architecture & custom memory. 


1. Print mathametical equations for each sentence in pytorch models. 
1. How many times has update operation of parameters happened in this network in one epoch?
1. How many times has the error value been reduced in this network in one epoch?
1. Maxpool after Conv or After Relu?

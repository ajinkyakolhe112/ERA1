Deep Learning
- Problem to be solved with a business value
- Data & Data Loader & being runnable for model. # DATA & BEAUTY OF GENERAL PURPOSE DATA
- Model Architecture & Being runnable for transformation. # Everything is about parameters. 
- Model Training
- Model Evaluate
- Experimentally Improve model
- Understand Model & Understand Problem & Understand other solutions. Experiment & improve according to frontier knowledge
- Load & Share Model. What are we saving? Values of Parameters & final parameter structure from training. Everything is about this
- Deploy Model

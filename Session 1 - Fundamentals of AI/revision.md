**Why & how to Revision**
- Before: Read & Confirm. But in brain its simply running recognition algorithm. And general thinking
- Improvement: While reading, in mind build entire knowledge mental model from scratch, with logical connections. Like Rohan. This will access through brain's neural network & build knowledge. 
Build your own, from scratch model, so that revision, is a creationist activity. Not just passive reading.
Each time connect to all the existing information in brain..

```python
input, output
for layer in model.layers:
	output = layer(input)
	input = output

```

#### Understanding Neural Networks
How network is known.  
- humans. neurons, connections & synapses. same number of neurons, different connections. each connection has weight parameter.
- only permanent record of a life lived is connections formed in brain, products you create and emotions people feel about you.
- connections, possible to transfere & upload. matrix learning via chip
- network is known in terms of connections, not the number of neurons.
- network is known for number of parameters. those are the knobs to adjust. and layer operation defined.

7k parameters. 
network with 7k adjustable parameters, learning on x data. 
once it learns, the accuracy of prediction, tells if the pattern complexity matches number of parameters complexity.

using 22 because 10 value is also num_classes. hence choosing number higher. 22. easier to distinguish.
- 7k parameters. mnist. (28,28,1) -> fc 784 to 22 -> fc 22 to 10 -> (1,10)
- 7k parameters. mnist. (28,28,1) -> conv2d (ch_out = 22, k = 28 ) -> fc 22 to 10 -> (1,10)

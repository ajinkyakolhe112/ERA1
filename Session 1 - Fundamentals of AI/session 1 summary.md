Python Memory Profile & Python Execution Profile

Evaluating Model. (What makes sense in model to evaluate?)
1. 
   
Tensorflow vs Pytorch
0. Standing on shoulders of giants. In any domain, past libraries and lessons learned and improved versions being continued.
1. Tensorflow is written from point of view of Google. To run their own huge workloads in highly optmized way for billions of users. 
2. Pytorch was a library with focus on "few simple and customizable and fast implementations" and simpler compiler.

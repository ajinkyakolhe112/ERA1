### Maths Equations for Visualization
$$
\large X_{single\_example} = [ x_{1}\ , x_{2}\ , \cdots\ , x_{n} ]\\
(Batch,X)
$$


### Steps of Building Code
- [x] Dataset
	- [x] MNIST Dataset
	- [x] Dataset Transformations
	- [x] DataLoader
	- [x] test
- [x] Model Architecture
  - [x] Initialization
  - [x] Forward Pass
- [x] Train Model & Monitor batch loss & total accuracy.
  - [x] Order of Operations
  - [x] $data = (X,Y), model, Y_{pred}, \\error\_func, optimizer, device$
  - [x] train loop $\huge y_{pred}, y$. 5 Steps

### Extra
  - [ ] Save & Load model. Save time on training
  - [ ] TensorBoard Monitoring Training
  - [ ] Weight & Bias Experiment Monitoring

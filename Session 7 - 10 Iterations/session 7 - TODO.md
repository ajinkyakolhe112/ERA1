Principles of Pytorch
1. Low Level Library & Pythonic. (Not comprehensive functions because low level. Just essential. Pythonic: Easy to Read Source Code)
	- Need to be familiar with its source code, because core essential functionality is given. Understand what is given & what is not given. Use external libraries or write own library
		- torchsummary or torchinfo
		- train & test methods in pytorch
	- Because Pythonic, its easier to read
	- Why Low Level??
		- Field is Nascent. New Knowledge needs to be implemented so library should be flexible
		- Hardware for running library: Nvidia, Cuda. New: Apple, AMD
		- Librares Optimized for Hardware. 
			- Pytorch
			- Julia or Jax for accelerated performance. Need to write things from scratch where library isn't built
2. Not just using Pytorch API, but reading source code & understanding how to do software engineering of Python + Forum + Podcast, together should give an deeper understanding of Pytorch
3. Writing Good README & Essential Functions & Fun Name Design. (Verbose - Succinct)

1. Data & DataLoader File
2. Model & Model Architecture File
3. Model Training Loop & Training model batch wise. Loss
4. Model Improvement Phase

Model loss not decreasing when training the model. For each batch, parameters are being updated according to the gradient. So loss should actually decrease in each step right. 
But, bard models, give 70% accuracy. Need to check





### Experiments & Questions
1. If conv2d(100,30,(1,1)). groups features together by their similarites, then shouldn't adding it after every 2 blocks help?. whatever features belong together, will be brough together,with appropriate possible permutations and combinations. ?

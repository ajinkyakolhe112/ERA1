Session 4 uses Alexnet & Vggnet Architectures in assignment. Before covering them. 
Before covering them later. Architecture consideration. 
Experience, them before we learn them. 

Questions about parameters and reasons. Only cover brute force NN for mnist. (Not jumping onto previous state of art directly)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

First 4 Sections about experimenting with MNIST. (without standing on shoulders of giants. So we can build upon them even further. Because the field is nascent, We need to learn to think of ourselves and innovate)
alexnet like architecture, just getting to the relevent receptive field. (
alexnet like architecture, just getting to the relevent receptive field. (not worrying about matrix size.)

only known operations. - (conv + fully connected layer + relu + max pooling)  total permutations for 2 layers. for 3 layers. what does each mean. 

assignments
1. finding mistakes in the code. 
2. rewriting it for readability (constant assignment) (restructure in files for modularity) (rewrite for modularity blocks) (rewrite code for readability for developer) (
3. explain 6 different architectures and their variations. 
4. develop your own custom variations of architectures for improvement. (no mention of existing architectures, so we learn to think for ourself)
5. parameters calculations & input size & output size & everything. Manual, Excel & torchinfo later. (Need to master manual because its essential for deep understanding. you should just know, because u calculate it for a general case. Only then you can innovate for any other architecture)
5. ask to analyze & critique, alexnet, vggnet and other architectures

SIMD Architecture
----------------- 
1. Same instruction, on different data. parallelized for this. 
2. Or having a few accelerated & seperate seperate hardware for those functions calculations. Apple's M1 Chip. And studying AI accelerators.


Should be able to flow from any concept to any other concept. Then you are teaching by going through all the concepts. 
Need to connect all connected subconcepts to all other concepts. should know those paths in mind. 
that's how by feynman technique, on same subject, again and again. constantly, repeatedly to build a mastery. 
monthly feynman technique of DL. Paper mental model. When doing it on paper, it actually needs to be connected in brain. like intentionality helps in memory. write same thing in multiple dimention, Maths, Latex, Programming, Etc
then after its put on paper, we can reflect on it, with meta awareness / brahamanda looking at it. 
cross connect after writing on paper. and that's how I will build complete mastery.

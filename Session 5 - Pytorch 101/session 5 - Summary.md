## Pytorch Details
1. *Pythonic* NN Library. 
  - 1st Design Principles. Usability over Performance with Reasonable Performance
  - Only 10% worse than Tensorflow which is focused on optmization for speed
  - Only 10% worse without implementing Compile like Tensorflow
2. *Usability*
3. *Learning from other libraries Mistakes*
4. *Constraints*: A few well optimized operations. Low Level Framework vs Low + High Level like Tensorflow. Less to write & optmize for low level.
5. *Error Messages*: Error Messages are not baked into Pytorch. Low Level Language. Need to understand what error is talking about, and where it's happening.

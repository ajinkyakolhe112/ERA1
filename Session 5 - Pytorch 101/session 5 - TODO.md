Week Goals

1. ZTM Week 1 redo
2. Redo Pytorch 101 script
3. Redo session 4 again
4. Redo ztm week 2 again
5. Pytorch Tutorials

Tiers of Coding
1. Individual Bits of code
2. Grouped codes for organization. And then experimentation focus
3. Experiment & iterate & improve. Experimentation of model architecture
4. Make test cases, modularity

1. Study dir of np, tf & torch, torch.nn and tf.nn and tf.keras

Here, should have created modular code for running experiemnts, but I did more as isolation of individual file. In Session 6, using notebook to run experiment, and designing with precise Names, makes writing code easier.
